This is the first post where I will be detailing the progress of my grad school research project. This project first started in my 3rd semester of grad school at Mercyhurst University where I am studying Data Science. The class I was enrolled in set the groundwork for my final semester’s project, and in that class is where I began to flesh out the actual project I will work on.

This project will attempt to build an accurate shot by shot predictor of golf scores for professional golfers on the PGA Tour. Using data from the ShotLink system that the PGA Tour provides, I am hoping to use not only the characteristics of each golfer’s skill levels, but also environmental and course characteristics to accurately predict the golfer’s final scores. This model will continually update to provide new predictions based on the outcome of the shot that was just hit.

I feel this could be very useful, and was seen to a certain degree during “The Match” with Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in 2018. During this broadcast, several betting odds were displayed on screen, but was used primarily for gambling purposes. I feel that this research could eventually allow golfers to perform simulations on an upcoming course or round and aid them in their course management and strategy by showing them where to hit the ball to provide the best possible outcomes.

Based on the reading I have done so far, there has only been a handful of attempts at this. Golf is quite random, so my initial goal is to get at least 90% accuracy on the score predictions.
